Hello, my name is Keith Butterfield and right now I am a contractor at TEKsystems that is assigned to Optum.  Optum will more than likely drop the contract with TEKsystems by the new year.  The team that I am on at Optum says you are one of three vendors that they work with so I am wondering if you would be able to make a new contract with me, so that I may stay employeed in the new year. 

You can contact me either by email or by phone/text at 320-980-0446

Thank you for your time!

Sincerly,
Keith Butterfield
